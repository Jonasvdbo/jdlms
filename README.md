# jDLMS library - temporary fork

This repository contains a temporary fork of the jDLMS library (https://www.openmuc.org/dlms-cosem/).

This fork contains some small changes to be able to connect to DSMR2.2 meters. The goal is that these changes will be incorporated in the official version of jDLMS. In the meantime, the GXF project uses this fork to support DSMR2.2 meters.

The license file of the jDLMS library can be found here: https://github.com/OSGP/jdlms/tree/main/license
