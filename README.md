# jDLMS library - temporary fork
This repository contains a temporary fork of the OpenMUC jDLMS library.

The OpenMUC jDLMS Library was developed by the "Intelligent Energy Systems" department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, located in Freiburg, Germany. For detailed information, you can visit the OpenMUC website: https://www.openmuc.org/dlms-cosem/.

We've made minor modifications to the OpenMUC jDLMS Library to facilitate connections to DSMR2.2 meters. Our objective is to have these adjustments integrated into the next official OpenMUC jDLMS release.
